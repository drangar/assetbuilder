# Asset Builder
Asset Builder is a containerized utility that currently runs on any container runtime environment (Docker/Podman/Colima etc). It uses a lightweight SQLiteDB database to store the metadata and an object store bucket to store the actual code/script files and the metadata database.

## Why Asset Builder?
Asset Builder is meant to serve the following purposes:
1) Enable collective intelligence
2) Bring consistency to how we showcase our capabilities/products
3) Efficient setup of demo environments

## What does it do?
Asset Builder allows individuals across the technical sales, client engineering, expert labs, support etc teams to capture assets/tasks that accomplish "something" for a given component/software. In addition to capturing assets/tasks, Asset Builder also enables sequencing of these assets/tasks and capturing these sequences as a "Use Case". 

By having a sequence of assets/tasks, this enables us to showcase our capabilities in a structured/planned manner and execute one asset/task at a time while we explain the process/value proposition of the capability we are showing to our customers. This helps us tell our story more effectively as we wait for the step in the process to complete.

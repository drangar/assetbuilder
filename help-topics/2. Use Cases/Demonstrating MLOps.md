# Demonstrating MLOps
Demonstrating MLOps involves executing a sequence of defined steps. Each step ideally should be run one at a time, and the results observed via the Cloud Pak for Data (CPD) user interface. This ensures clarity and traceability of the deployment pipeline.

If however you want to recreate a MLOps demo environment quickly, you could run all the steps below one after the other without stopping to walk through the CPD UI.

## 1. Install and configure `cpdctl` utility

**Description**:  
Install the `cpdctl` CLI tool and create the profile for CPD.  
For CPDaaS, provide:
- `ibmcloud_api_key`: Set to na if using CPD software  
- `ibmcloud_account_id`: Set to na if using CPD software 

For CPD software, provide:
- `cpd_url`  
- `cpd_username`  
- `cpd_apikey`

## 2. Import the MLOps Project

**Description**:  
Set up the demo project by importing assets from a zip file.  
You will need:
- `ibmcloud_api_key`: Set to na if using CPD software  
- `ibmcloud_account_id`: Set to na if using CPD software  
- `project_name`  

---

## 3. Create QA and PROD Deployment Spaces

**Description**:  
Create two deployment spaces (`QA` and `PROD`) and deploy the ML model to the QA space.

**Inputs**:
- `ibmcloud_api_key`: Set to na if using CPD software  
- `ibmcloud_account_id`: Set to na if using CPD software  
- `qa_deployment_space`  
- `prod_deployment_space`  
- `project_name`  

---

## 4. Evaluate the ML Model

**Description**:  
Evaluate the ML model deployed in the QA space using accuracy and precision metrics.

**Inputs**:
- `ibmcloud_api_key`: Set to na if using CPD software  
- `ibmcloud_account_id`: Set to na if using CPD software  
- `cpd_url`  
- `cpd_username`  
- `cpd_password`  
- `qa_deployment_space`  
- `project_name`

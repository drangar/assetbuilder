To better understand the contribution side of Asset Builder, one should walk through the steps below to create a test asset/task, save it and execute it to see the outcome.

## Step 1: Create simple asset/task to print input parameter values
One could use any scripting/programming language, we will walk through an example to create a bash-based asset and a python-based asset for the purpose of learning.

- Navigate to the "Home" tab
- Click on "Contribute to Asset Builder" button
- Select the "I don't have an IDE on my laptop, I want to write code using Asset Builder" option. This will open a code server based IDE in the browser window. It will default to your workspace home directory (your email id). Here one can create additional folder, sub-folders and files using the icons next to your email id.

- Click on the "folder" icon to create a new folder, call it "first_steps".
- Right-click on the "first_steps" folder and select "New file" and give it a file name simple_bash.sh
- Type the following code in simple_bash.sh

```
echo "I just executed the demo bash asset/task using the input parameters (param1 and param2)"
echo "param1="$param1
echo "param2="$param2
```

- Alternatively, create simple_bash.sh with the code above in you laptop, right click on "first_steps" folder and upload the file to Asset Builder.

# Frequently asked questions

1. Can I run it on any operating system?  
   Yes, the container image has been built as a multi-architecture image so it can run on any architecture X86, ARM etc.

2. Is it open for all IBMers and Business Partners?  
   We are initially focused on IBMers but once we solidify the governance process we will open it up for Business Partners as well.

3. Do I need to have an IDE installed on my laptop?  
   No, it comes with a built-in web-based IDE.

4. Do I still need Techzone?
   Yes, Asset Builder only hosts the collaboration platform for assets and the assets themselves. However one needs proper infrastructure such as Openshift/VM/Cloud Paks etc that are customized using the assets in Asset Builder. This infrastructure is provided through Techzone.

5. Can I use any extensions with the built-in IDE?
   Yes, one can install any extension available in the VS code/code server marketplace.

6. Can I upload/download files/folders to the built-in IDE?
   Yes, one can right-click on the left hand pane in the IDE and choose to upload/download/delete/copy files/folders etc.

7. Can I provide feedback (possible bugs, insufficient documentation, suggestions for additional parameterization/functionality etc) on existing assets?
   Today one would need to identify the author for the asset, this is displayed on the asset library screen. Contact them via slack to make suggestions. We are working on a more efficient method/screen to do this, should be available shortly.

8. What if I want changes to an asset and the author is not available to make changes immediately?
   Today you will need to make a copy of the asset, make changes and use it. We are working on a more efficient method/screen to do this, should be available shortly.

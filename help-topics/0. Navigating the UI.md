# Getting started with Asset Builder
First steps include getting familiar with the user interface, key capabilities and constraints.

## Navigating the user interface
Asset Builder has the following screens:

- Home  
- Asset/task library  
- Asset details  
- Use case flows  
- Use case library  
- Manage configuration  
- Long running processes  
- Help/How-to

### Home page
The Home page serves as the entry point for AssetBuilder, enabling the user to navigate to other functions and also providing quick statistics on assets and potential action items to address.

#### Contribute to Asset Builder
Clicking this button presents the user with options on how they could contribute to collective intelligence with new tasks/assets. They can use one of the available 3 methods to contribute new assets:
1. I have existing code assets, I want to clone my Git Repo
2. I have code on my laptop, I want to upload it to Asset Builder (Size limit: 100MB)
3. I don't have an IDE on my laptop, I want to write code using Asset Builder

> **IMPORTANT:** Cloning their Git Repo enables the contributor to selectively clone their GitHub repository, make necessary changes and share usable assets with the rest of the community.

> **NOTE:** Local file upload option allows contributors to upload zip files that will automatically be unzipped.

> **NOTE:** Built-in IDE that comes with Asset Builder is a full-fledged IDE that also supports all VS Code/Code Server extensions.

#### Explore and use existing assets
Clicking this button presents the user with the Asset library, allowing them to search for and find assets they are interested in using.

#### Assets in Draft that need validation/certification before publishing
This section lists assets contributed by other users that need to be "certified". Currently we have a simplistic governance approach where every assets is vetted by atleast 1 other user. The validation process involves ensuring that the title and description are self explanatory and the validating user also gets the option to review the code for any embedded passwords and/or other issues. If the validating user is happy with the asset, the click on the certify button upon which the asset status is changed to ACTIVE and becomes available for use to all users in the Asset library.

### Asset/task library
The Asset/task library page lists tiles for the different assets/tasks contributed by the community. It allows you to search/filter through the existing assets. Assets created by you can be edited and deleted, while assets created by others can be executed by anyone. Users can up/down vote existing assets and also bookmark or share assets with other users in the community.

#### Asset/Task Cards
Each card represents an individual asset or task. Each card includes:
- Checkbox (top-left): For selecting multiple assets/tasks.
- Thumbs up/down icons: For upvoting or downvoting the asset/task.
- Bookmark icon: To bookmark the asset/task for quick access.
- Trash icon: To delete the asset/task.
- Title: The name of the asset or task (e.g., "Install and configure cpd-cli utility").
- Author: Name of the creator
- Description: Brief summary of what the asset/task does, including inputs or key details.
#### Examples of Asset/Task Cards
- Install and configure cpd-cli utility: Installs a specific CLI utility with user credentials.
- Setup MLOps demo project: Sets up a demo project for MLOps.
- Generate demo data – Government: Generates sample data for analytic queries.
- Create Netezza objects for Government demo: Creates database objects for demo purposes.
- SQL Generation and Evaluation: Generates and evaluates SQL queries using LLMs.
#### Sidebar (Right Panel)
- Search: Text box to search for assets/tasks by keyword.
- Category: Dropdown to filter by asset/task category.
- Asset type: Dropdown to filter by type of asset/task.
- Bookmarked assets: Radio button to show only bookmarked items.
- Shared assets: Radio button to show only shared items.
- All assets: Radio button to show all items (default).
- Assemble use case: Blue button to initiate the process of assembling a use case from selected assets/tasks.

### Asset details
The asset details page allows you to add new or edit existing assets.

| Description | Brief description of the asset/task, including what input parameters are used. |
| Asset category | Category to classify the asset/task |
| Asset type | What type of asset/task is it (Bash, Python, Streamlit) |
| Is long running | Most assets are batch oriented and execute to completion but sometimes you might want the asset to continue running (Ex: streamlit applications) |
| Source location | Source sub-folder under which the code for the asset/task is stored |
| File to execute | Script/program for the asset/task |
| Input parameters | Input parameters for the asset/task including information on if it is required/optional and if there is a default value |
| Input parameter list | List of input parameters for the asset/task, one can remove existing input parameters |
| Enter dependency command(s) | Comma-separated list of commands (Ex: pip install numpy etc) to be executed before the asset/task is executed |
| Documentation URL | External documentation link for the asset/task |

### Use case flows
The use case flows tab enables the user to assemble use cases in a canvas and also execute either individual steps in the use case or all the steps in sequence. 

<img width="50%" height="50%" alt="Use case canvas" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/256c39b0-aa7b-4eeb-82d9-60cd63ed73bf" />

## Use case library
Use case library allows the end user to find/delete the use cases they created and also select and execute use cases created both by themselves and the broader community.

## Manage configuration
Manage configuration is to manage user-specific configuration such as git tokens etc, these configurations parameters and the values will only be locally stored on the users laptop. We currently support the following configurations:

- backend: Endpoint for Asset Builder backend
- gituser: Users github handle
- gittoken: Users github token
- enterprisegituser: Users enterprise github handle
- enterprisegittoken: Users github enterprise token	
- email: Email ID

## Long running processes
Asset Builder enables the execution of not just batch oriented processes the run to completion but also long running processes such as Streamlit applications, web applications etc. This tab shows a list of currently running "long running" processes. It also allows the user to free up resources on their laptop by terminating long running processes.

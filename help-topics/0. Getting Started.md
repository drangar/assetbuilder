- Use case flows  
- Use case library

#### Contribute to Asset Builder
Clicking this button presents the user with options on how they could contribute to collective intelligence with new tasks/assets. They can use one of the available 3 methods to contribute new assets:
1. I have existing code assets, I want to clone my Git Repo
2. I have code on my laptop, I want to upload it to Asset Builder (Size limit: 100MB)
3. I don't have an IDE on my laptop, I want to write code using Asset Builder

> **IMPORTANT:** Cloning their Git Repo enables the contributor to selectively clone their GitHub repository, make necessary changes and share usable assets with the rest of the community.

> **NOTE:** Local file upload option allows contributors to upload zip files that will automatically be unzipped.

> **NOTE:** Built-in IDE that comes with Asset Builder is a full-fledged IDE that also supports all VS Code/Code Server extensions.

#### Explore and use existing assets
Clicking this button presents the user with the Asset library, allowing them to search for and find assets they are interested in using.

#### Assets in Draft that need validation/certification before publishing
This section lists assets contributed by other users that need to be "certified". Currently we have a simplistic governance approach where every assets is vetted by atleast 1 other user. The validation process involves ensuring that the title and description are self explanatory and the validating user also gets the option to review the code for any embedded passwords and/or other issues. If the validating user is happy with the asset, the click on the certify button upon which the asset status is changed to ACTIVE and becomes available for use to all users in the Asset library.

### Asset/task library
The Asset/task library page lists tiles for the different assets/tasks contributed by the community. It allows you to search/filter through the existing assets. Assets created by you can be edited and deleted, while assets created by others can be executed by anyone. Users can up/down vote existing assets and also bookmark or share assets with other users in the community.

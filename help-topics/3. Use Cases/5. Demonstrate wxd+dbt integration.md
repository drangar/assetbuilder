# E-Commerce Lakehouse with dbt

This dbt project demonstrates how to model and test data in a **modern data lakehouse** architecture using **mock e-commerce data**. The project simulates building **dimensional models** (`customers`, `orders`) on top of raw data and applying **automated data quality checks** using dbt's built-in testing framework.

---

## Project Overview

- **Project Name:** `ecommerce_lakehouse`
- **Tooling:** `dbt`, `Python`, `watsonx_presto` (or compatible Presto/Trino target)
- **Environment Setup:** Fully automated via a Python script
- **Goal:** Demonstrate realistic dbt models and tests using synthetic data (no CSVs/files)

---

## Data Models

### 1. `customers` (Dimension Table)

Simulated raw data of customers, including:
- `customer_id`
- `customer_name`
- `email`
- `created_at`

### 2. `orders` (Fact Table)

Simulated transactional order data, including:
- `order_id`
- `customer_id` (FK)
- `order_date`
- `order_total`

Only orders with status `completed` are included in the model.

## dbt Tests Performed

### `customers` Model

| Column        | Test       | Description                          |
|---------------|------------|--------------------------------------|
| `customer_id` | `not_null` | Ensures every customer has an ID     |
| `customer_id` | `unique`   | Ensures no duplicate customer IDs    |
| `email`       | `not_null` | Validates presence of email address  |

### `orders` Model

| Column        | Test             | Description                                      |
|---------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `order_id`    | `not_null`       | All orders must have an ID                      |
| `order_id`    | `unique`         | Order IDs must not repeat                       |
| `customer_id` | `not_null`       | Each order must reference a customer            |
| `customer_id` | `relationships`  | Must match an ID in the `customers` model       |

## Expected Test Results

| Model     | Column        | Test             | Expected Result | Reason |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|-----------------|--------|
| customers | `customer_id` | `not_null`       |   Pass          | All customers have an ID |
| customers | `customer_id` | `unique`         |   Pass          | No duplicate IDs |
| customers | `email`       | `not_null`       |   Fail          | One customer has a missing email |
| orders    | `order_id`    | `not_null`       |   Pass          | All orders have an ID |
| orders    | `order_id`    | `unique`         |   Pass          | All IDs are distinct |
| orders    | `customer_id` | `not_null`       |   Pass          | No null customer references |
| orders    | `customer_id` | `relationships`  |   Fail          | One order references a customer ID not present in `customers` |

## Notes

- Failing tests are **intentional** to demonstrate dbt’s data validation capabilities.
- These failures help teams identify issues like:
  - Incomplete customer onboarding (missing email)
  - Dirty joins between raw data and reference dimensions
